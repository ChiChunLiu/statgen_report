Interpreting column names as follows:
zscore:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
non_effect_allele:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
sample_size:	Sample size
variant_id:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
effect_allele:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
pvalue:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from data/eur_w_ld_chr/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from data/gwas/UKB_20002_1111_self_reported_asthma.txt.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8856162 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 7427968 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 251724 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 1 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1176469 SNPs remain.
Removed 2 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1176467 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 224772.666667 (1176467 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 0.00286700087599, which seems sensible.
Removed 42 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1176425 SNPs remain).
